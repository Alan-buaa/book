# 概念

MLflow is organized into four components: [Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking), [Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#projects), [Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#models), and [Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#registry). You can use each of these components on their own—for example, maybe you want to export models in MLflow’s model format without using Tracking or Projects—but they are also designed to work well together.

MLflow’s core philosophy is to put as few constraints as possible on your workflow: it is designed to work with any machine learning library, determine most things about your code by convention, and require minimal changes to integrate into an existing codebase. At the same time, MLflow aims to take any codebase written in its format and make it reproducible and reusable by multiple data scientists. On this page, we describe a typical ML workflow and where MLflow fits in.
